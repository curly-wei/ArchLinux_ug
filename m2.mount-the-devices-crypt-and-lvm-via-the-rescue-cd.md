# M2.Mount the device's crypt and LVM via the "Rescue CD"

## 1.Open crypt device

```text
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb2 encrypted_device
#key in password to paraphrase

#/dev/sdb2: your crypt device
#encrypted_device: The device name is shown as "/dev/mapper/encrypted_device"
#in "/dev/mapper"
```

## 2.Mount your LVM device

If paraphrase is successful,

Your LVM device\(LV\) will arise in `/dev/vg0`

for example:

```text
ls /dev/vg0
```

will get

```text
LV_root
LV_home
LV_swap
```

you can mount these device via `/dev/vg0`

```text
mount /dev/vg0/LV_root /mnt
mount /dev/vg0/LV_home /mnt/home
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
```

or

```text
mount /dev/mapper/vg0-LV_root /mnt
mount /dev/mapper/vg0-LV_home /mnt/home
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
```
